[![minimum java](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=min%20java&message=v8&color=%23007396&logo=java)](https://adoptium.net/)

A utility for inspecting portions of the KoLmafia local environment, downloading new versions and launching [KoLmafia](https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia).


Note - this is still a work in progress made public to deal with some resource issues.  Assistance in setting up the project so that permissions and protections and authorizations are the same as KoLmafia is solicted and appreciated.  Same for workflows and tasks associated with commits and PRS.  The Java is actively being refactored so leaving it alone until I remove this portion of the README will make my life easier.
